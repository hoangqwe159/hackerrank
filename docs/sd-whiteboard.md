## System design JIRA board

### Requirements
- CRUD elements
- Select, moving, resizing, rotation
- Zooming
- Saving in server, in browser
- Undo redo, copy paste
- Keyboard navigation
- Collaboration
- Does it support offline?
- Does it support live update?
- Doest it require SEO?
- Is there any authentication required?

### Non-functional requirements
- Demographics (internationalization) and Accessibility: Semantic HTML + ARIA attribute + screen reader + shortcut
- Performance: >- 60 FPS with 5k elements
- Security: XSS, Cross-site request forgery
- UIX, responsive
- Scalability:  should be optimized for performance, ensuring it remains efficient and responsive even as the data size or the number of users grows
- CI/CD, tooling, testing strategy
- Observability + Analytics: Ensure logging mechanisms to track system health and performance, keeping in mind the cost implications of log storage. Consider storing logs selectively or aggregating them.
- Flexibility: Allow rapid prototyping and new feature plug-ins.

### Architecture
- SSR vs CSR
- **SSR**: for a fast initial load but the benefits of SSR will only be limited to performance gains because chat applications don't need to be SEO-friendly
- **CSR**:  Rendering in the browser, by dynamically adding DOM elements into the page using JavaScript. Best for interactive content.
- **Hybrid approach** which gives the best of both worlds: a fast initial load with SSR then hydrating the page to attach event listeners for user interactions.
- Menu toolbar and Whiteboard
- Diagram MVC
  - Model: Represents the data layer of the application. It communicates with the database and updates the view whenever the data changes.
  - View: Represents the user interface and the presentation of the data. It displays the data from the model to the user and sends the user commands to the controller.
  - Controller: Interacts with both the model and the view. It takes the user input from the view, processes it (with possible updates to the model), and returns the output display.
- Components: composable and reusable UI components that can adapt across products. Atomic components, Presentation-Container
- Canvas vs SVG:
  - huge elements: canvas > svg
  - implementation: svg > canvas because of native api (css, event listener)
- List some sample flows: lazy load, progressive fetch, pagination
- The whiteboard is built on a unidirectional multi-phase rendering pipeline, comprising:
	1.	Capture Phase: Collect input from user. centralise handle all DOM event handling in one place. Use raw DOM APIs to achieve event delegation on document.body. State Machines for user interactions.
	2.	Update Phase: Process inputs using a command system.ECS
	3.	Render Phase: Translate updated state into WebGL draw calls.

A persistent game loop (driven by requestAnimationFrame) ties all three phases together, akin to real-time rendering engines used in games.

  â€¢	Entity Component System (ECS) for modeling whiteboard elements.
    â€¢	Entity: Abstract object with no identity.
    â€¢	Component: Data describing traits (position, draggable, visible).
    â€¢	System: Logic operating on entities with matching components.
. For each of these, we have been able to re-use entire interaction patterns by simply attaching â€˜traitsâ€™ to them, and iterate at an increasing rate on the features we are building. For a recently added element (sections), copy, paste, cut, selection, dragging, deleting, undo, redo, duplicating and a whole host of other interactions were re-used without any additional code being added.
	â€¢	Command Pattern for interaction decoupling.
	â€¢	break up the â€˜infiniteâ€™ digital canvas into regions 2048 x 2048 in size. Virtualisation to avoid off-screen work. attaches a VisibleComponent to all visible entities in ECS, which is then used to act only on visible elements when rendering or performing expensive computations.
	â€¢	WebGL Instancing for batch rendering.

Rendering Dom React vs WebGL
- React: fast development, easy integration, debug, accessibility. Slow performance 1k + element, Inefficient Rendering memory bloat and frequent reflows/repaints, limited in rendering complex visuals
- WebGL: Extreme Performance, direct access to GPU for custom effects, Smooth Interactions like zoom dragging, Memory Efficiency; complicated, hard to debug, Accessibility challenges, more development effort, cross platform problems
- Use DOM for UI (menus, toolbars) and WebGL for canvas rendering, with event bridging in between.
- Virtual DOM compare 2 states of whiteboard, detect the difference and render
- Slow collaboration:
    - Multiple users can edit the same document.
    - The last saved version overwrites previous ones.
    - Works well when there are few users and no concurrent edits on the same document.
    - Transmitting the entire document is acceptable in this mode.
- Live collaboration:
    - Multiple users edit the document simultaneously, with changes reflected in real time.
    - Requires a system to transmit only the changes (deltas).
- Floor control model: Only one user can edit the document at a time.
    - Locks model: A more refined version of floor control, where objects are locked during editing.
        - However, this introduces network latency and delays, which could be frustrating.
    - Transaction-based model (like Git): Tracks changes and merges them later.
    - Version-detection model:
        - Document state is replicated across all users.
        - Edits are made locally and synchronized to others.
        - Used by tools like Google Docs and Canva.
        - 
A central server handles requests and data from multiple clients, maintaining control over the shared resources and acting as the source of truth.

Advantages
	â€¢	Centralized control: All data updates go through a single authoritative server.
	â€¢	Data consistency: New or returning clients can easily fetch the latest document version.
	â€¢	Robustness: Handles client crashes or disconnections smoothly, as the server persists the latest state.

Disadvantages
	â€¢	Single point of failure: If the server goes down, the entire system may become unusable.
	â€¢	Higher infrastructure cost: Requires powerful servers and ongoing maintenance.
	â€¢	Scalability limits: Needs careful scaling to support a growing number of clients.

ðŸ”· Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model

Overview

Every participant acts as both client and server. Data is shared directly among peers without a central authority.

Advantages
	â€¢	Lower latency: Direct communication reduces response time.
	â€¢	Cost efficiency: Eliminates the need for centralized infrastructure.
	â€¢	Scalability: Load is distributed across all participants.

Disadvantages
	â€¢	Synchronization complexity: No clear source of truth leads to potential inconsistencies.
	â€¢	Consensus overhead: Requires additional logic for resolving document versions when peers join or leave.
	â€¢	Persistence issues: A server is still needed to ensure long-term storage.
	â€¢	Security risks: A compromised peer can affect all others.

âœ… Recommended Model: Client-Server

Despite having more visible drawbacks, the client-server model is typically preferred in collaborative systems due to two critical factors:
	1.	Reliable Source of Truth: Guarantees all participants can access the most up-to-date and verified data.
	2.	Persistent Storage: Ensures that all updates are saved to a database reliably, even if clients disconnect abruptly.

ðŸ›  Optimization Tip:

To mitigate its weaknesses, the client-server model can be enhanced using:
	â€¢	Server redundancy for fault tolerance.
	â€¢	Auto-scaling infrastructure for high traffic handling.
	â€¢	Load balancers to distribute client requests efficiently.

### Data model
  - State management: Redux, Zustand, React Context
    - Redux: high boilerplate, lot of setups, requires external library, require custom memoization, mature and huge community support. One project, does not require re-setup
    - Zustand, react-sweet-state: Minimalistic and flexible state management, simple API, good performance for medium-sized apps but built with React Context and Hooks for better performance and debugging. State logic is co-located with component logic (feels like useState, but global).  Supports partial state subscriptions to avoid unnecessary renders. No need global provider
    - nesting ability: Sweet-state works great when you want your components to be resilient to whatever wraps them: as there is no Provider concept you can mix & match/nest components as you please, while nesting Redux providers can become challenging.
    - Limited Ecosystem
    - avoid Redux to reduce boilerplate, opting instead for something more hook-centric and efficient for their scale.
- Data to be persisted
  - localstorage: Simple, persists after refresh, Accessible from any tab, small size limit. Should use when we open new tab, the data shared across tab
  - sessionStorage: Ends with tab/window session, Isolated to the tab that set it. Should use when only we want to persist the state after refresh, clear when open new tab
  - IndexedDB: large, async, support a lot of data type, best use for offline support, store documents, image assets
- Client data model
- Data normalization: Whenever possible, aim for a normalized data structure on the client. Normalization means storing each entity type separately by ID rather than nesting full objects within other objects. This approach avoids data duplication, keeps your state consistent, and simplifies updates.
- Normalise the data: Keep tickets, columns as dictionary, the order is maintained by array id

### Interface (API)


### Optimisation
## Network:
- Images: Pull specific image sizes based on the viewport using web-compressed formats like WebP, when available; otherwise, use PNG.
- Compression: Utilize GZIP or Brotli for text compression to minimize the payload size sent over the network.
- Rendering Optimizations
- Infinite scrolling + lazy load items as they enter the viewport, reducing initial load times.
- Virtualization: is beneficial for performance when dealing with long lists.
- Hybrid Rendering: Utilize a combination of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for the initial load and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for dynamic interactions, capitalizing on the strengths of both rendering methods

## JavaScript Optimizations
- Always compress your assets, whether youâ€™re shipping JS, CSS, images, or data. Smaller files mean faster delivery and a snappier user experience.
- Dynamic Imports: Import only what you need and use lazy loading for non-critical features such as modals.
- Code Splitting: Implement bundle splitting to separate critical resources and defer non-critical ones, which can reduce the initial load time.
- Inline critical css for above-the-fold content, write CSS in JS and using compile tool to output them as atomic CSS
    - Styles are easier to find
    - Styles are more convenient to maintain
    - No need to worry about cascading nature of style sheets
    - Tidier codebase
    - Manipulate styles in more powerful ways, such as nested rules
- Batch Requests: When possible, group similar network requests into a single batch. This reduces the number of round trips and makes better use of available bandwidth.
- Caching: service worker for static content + tanstack query
- Resilience in slow networks: skeletons, retries, optimistic UI. Cover state transitions and UI edge cases: error â†’ retry â†’ loading again, race conditions.
- Preconnect + DNS prefetch
- memoization strategies, useMemo,useCallback, React.memo, and avoiding unnecessary renders.

## Security Considerations
- Data Validation: Rigorously validate all data on the server side to prevent SQL injection and other forms of attacks.
- API Security: Protect APIs with rate limiting, debounce/throttle rapid changes and access controls to prevent abuse. 
- HTTPS: Employ HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection: Sanitize user input to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. Most modern frameworks provide built-in XSS protection.
- Configure CORS policies to control which cross-origin requests are permitted, preventing unwanted web pages from pulling resources or making API requests.
- Regular Audits: Conduct regular security audits and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML tags to provide meaningful structure and help screen readers interpret the content.
- Aria Attributes: Apply ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance accessibility, especially in dynamic content and complex user interfaces.
- Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are operable with keyboard-only controls.
- Maintain high contrast ratios for text and interactive elements to support users with visual impairments.
- Font size with REM, font family, spacing
- Alt Text for Images: Provide descriptive alt text for images, so screen readers can convey the information they contain.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is usable on a range of devices and screen sizes.
- Error Handling: Design clear error messages and provide suggestions for resolution to assist users when they encounter input errors.
- Testing: Perform accessibility testing with real users, including those who rely on assistive technologies.
- Internationalization
    - Set theÂ **`lang`**Â attribute on theÂ **`html`**Â tag
    - Right-to-left languages
    - Consider differences in the length of text in different languages.
    - Do not concatenate translated strings.
    - Do not put text in images.
    - Be mindful of how colours are perceived in different cultures.

## CI/CD
- Git strategy: PR required, protected branches, git workflow
- CI: Tests, lint, build, yarn audit, type check on pre-commit, on PR
- CD: write pipeline for auto deploy, tag-based deploys, add some manual approval gates if needed in pipeline for production
- Performance, E2E test: `data-testid` , use lighthouse CI catch performance regressions, set threshold TTI < 1.5s, unit test logic, during development suggest the use of performance tab to see bottle necks,
- Enable feature preview and feedback
- Monitor in production: custom analytics (store in indexedDB and send via service workers in Batch) or Sentry
- Developer experience investment: using barrel file for hot reload, consider fast dev tools like vite, vitest, biome, set up local dev environment close to production, config our own agent in a Mac machine to support turbo caching, and run Azure pipeline
- Document everything
- Mono repo vs polyrepo

**Drag and drop library**: using native browser api for drag and drop (generate snapshot for image, draggable="true"), bundle size small, Framework agnostic, module and extensible plugins: indicator, hit box, auto scroll, animation, full style control, no dependency, need to work on mobile
