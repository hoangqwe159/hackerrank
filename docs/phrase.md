## Project Execution & Driving Outcomes
- I made sure the goals were clear before writing a single line of code.
- I planned the work in small steps so we could stay on track and adjust quickly.
- I talked with the product manager often to make sure we didn‚Äôt miss anything important.
- To avoid delays, I checked in early with the backend team about dependencies.
- I kept the team updated so everyone knew what to expect and when.

## Learning from Experience
- That project didn‚Äôt go as planned, but I learned a lot from it.
- I made a mistake, but I took notes and shared what I learned with the team.
- After the release, I looked back at what worked and what didn‚Äôt.
- Next time, I used what I learned to improve how I planned my tasks.
- I now check more often with others to catch problems early.
- That mistake helped me understand how important early communication is.
- After that project, I started double-checking assumptions before writing code.
- I now make sure to get feedback early instead of waiting until the end.
- Looking back, I should‚Äôve asked more questions‚Äînow I always clarify before diving in.
- It taught me to slow down and focus on the problem before jumping into the solution.
- I realized I needed to involve the QA team earlier, and that made a big difference next time.
- That experience showed me how valuable pair programming can be during tricky parts.
- Since then, I‚Äôve been more proactive in raising concerns before they become blockers.
- I learned that even small UI bugs can have a big impact on users.
- Now I always do a quick post-release review, so I don‚Äôt repeat the same mistake.

## Team Collaboration
- I like working closely with others to solve problems together.
- When someone got stuck, I offered to help and we fixed it faster as a team.
- I made sure to keep the designer in the loop so the UI turned out right.
- I try to make it easy for others to understand my code and jump in if needed.
- We held a quick sync every day to stay aligned and support each other.

## Using Data or Logic to Influence
- I showed numbers to back up my idea, and it helped the team agree.
- We looked at past bugs to decide the best way forward.
- I shared user feedback to explain why the change mattered.
- Instead of arguing, I shared a quick prototype so people could see the result.
- I listened to their view and explained mine clearly with real examples.

##  Leadership Without Title
- I saw something we could improve, so I took the lead to fix it.
- Even though I wasn‚Äôt the tech lead, I helped guide the direction of the project.
- I mentored a new teammate so they could work more independently.
- I raised concerns early so the whole team could make better choices.
- I suggested a better way of doing things and got others on board.

##  Customer Obsession
- When something broke for a user, I fixed it fast and followed up.
- I always think about how the user will feel when using our product.
- I watched real user sessions to understand their pain points.
- I once shipped a bug, but I owned it and made sure it didn‚Äôt happen again.
- The customer‚Äôs voice matters most to me when making decisions.

##  Feedback (Giving & Receiving)
- I asked my teammate for feedback so I could improve my approach.
- When I saw something that could be better, I gave honest but kind feedback.
- I take feedback seriously and try to apply it right away.
- We do retros after projects, and I always speak up and share ideas.
- I told my manager what was working and what could be better for the team.

## Making Trade-offs & Course Correction
- We had to change plans mid-way, and I helped the team adapt quickly.
- When a feature was too complex, I suggested a simpler first version.
- We missed something in the early design, but I helped fix it fast.
- I focused on what mattered most to users and cut the rest.
- Sometimes speed matters more than perfection, so I picked what worked best for now.

## Impact-Driven Phrases (Simple, Effective)
- Because of my work, users were able to complete tasks faster and with fewer clicks.
- My refactor cut page load time in half, which improved user experience right away.
- The component library I built helped other developers move faster and stay consistent.
- I fixed a recurring bug that had been frustrating users for months.
- After I introduced the new testing process, we caught more issues before release.
- My changes reduced the need for design handovers, saving both dev and design time.
- Thanks to my idea, we avoided a major delay and still launched on time.
- I spotted an accessibility issue early and made sure we met compliance before launch.
- I led a small initiative that improved code quality across the whole frontend team.
- My proactive communication helped align product, design, and engineering, avoiding last-minute rework.
