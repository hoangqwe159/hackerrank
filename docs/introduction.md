1. No-Code CMS Platform: This platform empowers industry clients to create applications compatible across all platforms, including PWA, iOS, Android, and web. I led the system migration from React Native to pure React + Capacitor, which significantly enhanced cross-platform functionality and responsiveness. I also developed and designed a new system of UI components for the platform, ensuring scalability and a seamless user experience.
2. SVG Editor: I have experience maintaining the legacy SVG editor with over 2 million users, and I am the founding engineer of a new, advanced SVG editor. This new platform has a more intuitive UI, richer features, and integrated AI capabilities, creating a superior user experience and supporting a wider range of creative tools.

In terms of frontend and system design, I am proficient across a wide array of technologies. For the no-code platform, I set up a robust new system architecture in React and Capacitor, implementing advanced features such as live collaboration in PDF document, HTML editor with a comment system, and a change-tracking mechanism. With a mobile-first, responsive design approach, I ensure the applications work seamlessly across any screen size.

I also have extensive experience with offline-first architecture and database management. I designed an offline-capable SQL database utilizing Service Worker, SharedWorker, and WebAssembly (WASM) with Shared Array Buffer and Atomics for reliable transactions. This setup optimizes performance and ensures continuity, even in offline conditions.

My skills also include implementing various native mobile functions like QR code scanning, OCR, NFC, camera integration, video recording, MSAL and map functionalities, which add significant value to mobile applications.

In terms of build and deployment, I am highly skilled in tools like Rollup, Vite, and Webpack, implementing tree shaking and other optimizations. This resulted in a three times improvement in development pipeline efficiency, accelerating the build process and supporting faster deployment cycles.

Finally, my adaptability and drive to solve complex technical challenges are evident in recent projects, like developing a custom Capacitor plugin with Java and Swift to integrate MSAL for native apps, which expanded our platform’s capabilities and provided seamless authentication options.

I’ve been working in start-up since day one, and it's been an incredible learning experience. Early on, the fast-paced environment really helped me grow quickly—especially in frontend development. I had the chance to take on a lot of responsibility and work across different parts of the stack, which accelerated my growth. But over time, as the product and team stabilized, the learning curve started to flatten. We're a small team, so while I still enjoy the work, I’ve been feeling the need for a bigger environment where I can collaborate with more engineers, learn from others, and tackle more complex challenges. I’m also excited about the idea of building something that impacts a much larger user base—seeing my code make a difference at scale is something I really care about. That’s why I’m looking for a new opportunity, and Atlassian is exactly the kind of place where I believe I can keep growing while contributing meaningfully

I’ve been using Atlassian products like Jira and Confluence for a long time, and I know how much they shape the way teams work and collaborate—I've relied on them daily. The idea of being part of the team that builds these tools, tools I genuinely respect and depend on, is incredibly motivating. On top of that, I really admire Atlassian’s culture—especially the focus on openness, collaboration, and continuous improvement. That kind of environment aligns perfectly with how I want to grow in my career. I’m excited about the chance to learn from a talented team, contribute to products that help millions of users, and keep pushing myself technically and professionally

Level 4: Architects & Experts
Design scalable front end applications that support hundreds or thousands of features and pages, setting technical standards and mentoring teams. I want to be an expert (top 1%) in niche topics like browser internals, WebGL, animations, web performance, WebAssembly, build tools, etc.

Level 5: Visionaries
Redefine front end engineering by evolving the web standards (WHATWG, TC39, etc.) or pioneering new paradigms like component-based systems, Flux architecture, server-driven UIs, server components, local-first apps, etc. They drive innovation and shape the future direction of front end development and its ecosystem. Few people ever get to this level.
